                            Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial
                            Trust of Australia. The Trust began consideration of erecting a
                            building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in
                            1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne
                            Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd
                            to design the building.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in
                            addition was to provide rental office accommodation for
                            commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the
                            Trust. Features of the original design included:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north
                                wing, which housed a display on the work of the Trust;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                the flat roof area of the east and south wings which was
                                intended to be a roof terrace; and
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                accommodation in the building included a board room, dining
                                room, reception area, bar and kitchen.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The cost of the works was about $1 million. The building was
                            officially opened on 14 April 1972.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was
                            engaged by the Trust as its site representative to replace Boyd.

                            Robin Boyd CBE HFRAIA (1919-1971) is a noted Australian
                            architect. Boyd was a member of a prominent artistic family, and
                            combined a career as an architect, author and critic (Clerehan
                            1993). He was strongly influenced by the Modern Movement, and
                            deeply interested in the development of Australian architecture.
                            Boyd is often remembered best for his domestic architecture, as
                            well as his books, but he also produced designs for larger scale
                            works, such as in the case of Churchill House. Boyd was awarded
                            the Gold Medal by the RAIA in 1969, and made an honorary fellow
                            in 1970.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Boyd was strongly influenced later in his career by the post-war
                            concrete architecture produced in Japan (Taylor 1990:80). This
                            Brutalist style is evident in the design for Menzies College
                            Student Housing (1968) and in the design for Churchill House. In
                            this latter phase, Boyd was seeking larger scale projects,
                            although with only limited success.

                        <p>
                            During the 1990s the glass pavilion was replaced by the
                            current north wing.
                        </p>

                            Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings
                            designed in the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These
                            include:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>National Gallery of Australia, 1971;</li>
                            <li>Cameron Offices, 1976;</li>
                            <li>Canberra School of Music, 1976; and</li>
                            <li>High Court of Australia, 1980.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of
                            only two examples of an office building. While Brutalism has
                            been described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic (Banham
                            1966:10), both office buildings display a more restrained form
                            compared to the other buildings, several of which were intended
                            to portray a distinctive image in the national capital.
