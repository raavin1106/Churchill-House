      <p>
        Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and
        south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a
        rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing
        it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building
        is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast
        corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.
      </p>

      <h3>Main Building</h3>

      <p>
        The main building displays several different elevational treatments. The
        elevations facing onto the pool area feature floor to ceiling glass with
        minimal black metal frames to the lowest level, and precast vertical
        panels on the upper two storeys. Each panel has a projecting fin and are
        relatively narrow, with the overall affect being of closely spaced
        vertical fins. Beside the fins are narrow, slot windows providing
        minimal outlook onto the pool area.
      </p>

      <p>
        The south and east elevations are quite different in character having
        long horizontal sections of flush-mounted glazing set in minimal black
        metal frames, with timber-textured off-form concrete spandrels between
        storeys. The base course of the elevation is a large section
        black-coated steel beam. Several window-mounted airconditioners are
        located on the south elevation. The blank end walls of the wings and the
        lift tower are off-form, timber-textured concrete with incised storey
        lines.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the junction of the two wings are the foyers for each floor as well
        as the service core including the lift. Apart from the off-form concrete
        walls of the service elements, the foyers feature glazing set in black
        metal frames which extends the full height of the building. At the
        ground floor level the glazing is vertical but above that for the
        remaining two storeys it is sloping.
      </p>

      <p>
        The building has concrete slab floors which are either carpeted or
        finished in slate. Some interior walls are textured, off-form concrete
        similar to the exterior. Other walls are lightweight partitions. There
        is a mixture of ceiling treatments: off-form concrete, suspended
        ceilings and set plasterboard. Many of the interior fitouts appear
        relatively modern and are not original.
      </p>

      <p>
        The roof of the main building is set behind a parapet and appears to be
        graded concrete with a membrane coating.
      </p>

      <h3>North Wing</h3>

      <p>
        The north wing replaces an earlier pavilion on the same location. The
        current wing is a two storey structure with a flat metal deck roof set
        behind a parapet. The wing has an encircling steel colonnade which
        supports the roof and parapet. The walls are set back from the colonnade
        and feature flush-mounted glazing set in thin black metal frames, with
        textured off-form concrete spandrels, similar to the south wall of the
        south wing. There is an enclosed link between the north and east wings
        at the ground floor level.
      </p>

      <h3>Pool Area, Carpark and Landscaping.</h3>

      <p>
        The pool area is lower than the surrounding site, and being mostly
        enclosed by the wings, has the quality of a sunken courtyard. The pool
        area is reached by a large flight of concrete steps from the west, and
        features a pond which borders a large, raised central island which is
        reached from one side by a set of bridging steps. The island has
        concrete paving, garden beds and silver birch trees, and is the location
        for a large fibreglass statue of Sir Winston Churchill.
      </p>

      <p>
        The carpark is constructed in off-form concrete, with walls displaying
        the texture of the timber formwork.
      </p>

      <p>
        Churchill House has a number of landscape/garden areas. At the front
        (west) of the building is an open lawn area and either side are mixed
        native/exotic plantings. The pool area contains numerous trees and
        shrubs, again of mixed native/exotic species. A small courtyard to the
        southeast of the main building features bamboo.
