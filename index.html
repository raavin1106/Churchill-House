                        <p>
                            Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was
                            designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust
                            of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971.
                            It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its
                            completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs
                            produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Several components make up the complex. The main building, with
                            east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the
                            central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L
                            shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a
                            large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high
                            with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north
                            wing and the carpark are two storeyed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the
                            building still displays key features of the brutalist style with
                            its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping
                            structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall
                            panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit
                            windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in
                            comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in
                            this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and
                            High Court of Australia.

                    <p>
                        Boyd is arguably the most influential architect there has been in
                        Australia. Through his writings Boyd inspired the general
                        community and through his architecture he has become an
                        acknowledged leader in the design and architectural professions.
                        He was a renowned Victorian architect, author, critic, and public
                        educator in the 50s and 60s, a leader in Melbourne’s Modern
                        Architecture movement, a visionary in urban design, and outspoken

                    <p>
                        Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began
                        consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968.
                        In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the
                        architect Robin Boyd to design the building.

                        The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental office
                        accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust.

                    <p>
                        Churchill House was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia
                        in 1969-70 and construction was completed in 1971. The building is an example of the Late
                        Twentieth-Century Brutalist Style (1960-) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form
                        concrete.
                        The complex comprises a number of components: the main building with its east and south wings,
                        the separate north wing or pavilion, the pool and the rear carpark. The main building forms an L
                        shape in plan, and with the north wing it encloses on three sides a courtyard in which the pool
                        is located.

                            Statement of Significance
                        </h3>
                        <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-),
                            displaying several key features as follows:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                            <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the
                                south and east wings.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping
                            structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun
                            protection,
                            and vertical slit windows.</p>

                        <p>Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style,
                            and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative
                            approach to the style because of the intended office use.</p>

                        <p>The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their
                            understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.Churchill House has interest
                            for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The
                            building was his last major commission.</p>
