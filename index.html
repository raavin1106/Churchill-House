                            Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was
                            designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust
                            of Australia in 1969 – 70, and construction was completed in
                            1971.

                        <strong>It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its

                            produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist
                            building.</strong>

    <!-- Home Categories -->
    <!-- This is going to be a section, so going to use the HTML5 section tag and I gave the ID of home-articles and also going to 
        create padding class, so going to give it a class of py-2, to just give home articles some padding on the top and bottom. -->
    <!-- So the home articles are going to be postioned a little different, so for instance the first article 'CHURCHILL HOUSE' I'm actually going to make 
        that a grid within a grid so that we can align it the way shown when viewing my website - article image on the left and article text on the right. And some 
        articles will have the article text on top and article image on bottom of the grid and some articles will have the article image on top and article text on bottom. So they 
        will be formatted a little bit differently. -->
    <section id="home-articles" class="py-2">
        <!-- Added this container to wrap around everything, this will show padding on the edge of the website for the articles and it aslo aligns it
                 to the middle. -->

            <!-- Created this container for our grid -->
            <div class="articles-container">
                <!-- So here I created the first home article - 'CHURCHILL HOUSE' which is again going to be a grid within a grid, it 
                        will have the article image on the left and article text on the right. -->
                <!-- Each of the articles are going to be an article tag and I gave the article tags a card class, so what my intentions was
                        when creating this class, card is something you see in frameworks like bootstrap where you have maybe a background like mine with a 
                        white background and some padding just something to put your content into rather than just having the text and images just floating 
                        there with just the background. So those are going to be cards, so each one of these articles will have a class of card. I decided 
                        to create the card class for each of the articles rather than targeting the article element itself because since this is my first time
                        using grid layout, I wanted my code to look more clearer, and know that there was a card class being used in all these articles. But overall 
                        just targeting the article element in CSS would have definetly been better and neat. But then again both these methods are correct and do the 
                        same thing. -->

                            Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was
                            designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust
                            of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971.
                            It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its
                            completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs
                            produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Several components make up the complex. The main building, with
                            east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the
                            central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L
                            shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a
                            large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high
                            with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north
                            wing and the carpark are two storeyed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the
                            building still displays key features of the brutalist style with
                            its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping
                            structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall
                            panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit
                            windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in
                            comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in
                            this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and
                            High Court of Australia.

                    <p>
                        Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century
                        Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features. The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.

                    <p>
                        Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust
                        of Australia. The Trust began consideration of erecting a building
                        of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In
                        1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the
                        current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the
                        building.
