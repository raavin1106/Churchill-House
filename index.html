          Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by
          Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in
          1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last
          major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a
          small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s
          first brutalist building.

            Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919-1971) was a nationally and
            internationally renowned architect. He was also widely published and
            appreciated as an architectural critic. In 1953 Robin Boyd, Roy
            Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the practice of Grounds,
            Romberg and Boyd which became a leading architectural firm in
            Melbourne. The firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.

          <p>
            Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century
            Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as
            follows:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south
              wing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the
              spandrels to the south and east wings.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this
            style including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>sloping structural fins</li>
            <li>precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels</li>
            <li>precast fins for sun protection</li>
            <li>vertical slit windows</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style,
            and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting,
            perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the
            intended office use.
          </p>

          <p>
            The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of
            designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century
            Architectural Styles.
          </p>

          <p>
            Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent
            architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
