        Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by
        Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in
        1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last
        major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a
        small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first
        brutalist building.

        <h2>Robin Boyd</h2>

        <p>
          Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919-1971) was a nationally and
          internationally renowned architect. He was also widely published and
          appreciated as an architectural critic. In 1953 Robin Boyd, Roy
          Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the practice of Grounds, Romberg
          and Boyd which became a leading architectural firm in Melbourne. The
          firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.

        <h2> Statement of Signifigance</h2>

        <p>
          Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century
          Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south
            wing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the
            spandrels to the south and east wings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style
          including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>sloping structural fins</li>
          <li>precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels</li>
          <li>precast fins for sun protection</li>
          <li>vertical slit windows</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and
          one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a
          more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office
          use.
        </p>

        <p>
          The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of
          designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century
          Architectural Styles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent
          architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
